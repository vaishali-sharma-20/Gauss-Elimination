# Gauss-Elimination
In this method, the problem of systems of linear equation having n unknown variables, matrix having rows n and columns n+1 is formed. This matrix is also known as Augmented Matrix. After forming n x n+1 matrix, matrix is transformed to upper trainagular matrix by row operations. Finally result is obtained by Back Substitution.
